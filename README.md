# Attendance System

### Description

This application is a final project for Object-Oriented Programming (2024), designed as an attendance tracking system for the BSCPE 1-1 schedule during the second semester. It uses a console-based interface to verify student credentials, track attendance based on their arrival time, and generate attendance reports.

### Features:

- **Student Verification**: Validates student numbers.
- **Subject Scheduling**: Displays weekly scheduled subjects.
- **Attendance Recording**: Tracks arrival times and evaluates attendance status (present, late, absent).
- **Reports**: Generates detailed attendance and summary reports.

### Functions and Procedures:

- `Account.cs`: Handles student credential verification.
- `Menu.cs`: Manages user navigation and subject selection.
- `Attendance.cs`: Records attendance details and delegates report generation.
- `AttendanceFunction.cs`: Evaluates attendance status based on timing.
- `Report.cs` and `ReportFunction.cs`: Collect and display detailed attendance summaries.
